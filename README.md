# odin-recipes
Very first project to go over and refine the usage of basic HTML elements and attributes. 

## Pre-project Expectations and goal setting:

The project *scope* is a simple site to showcase recipes and skills in working with different types of lists, images, links and other basic HTML features.

The *goal* of the project is to reinforce knowledge through practice whilst providing a convenient way to organise and keep my mealplan in one place. 

The *restriction* of the project is its deliberate focus on a limitated number of HTML features.

To *overcome limitations*, the focus will be on knowledge expansion and designing the site in a way that it showcases the strengths of semantic HTML website design and presentation.

## Post-project Review and Notes:
